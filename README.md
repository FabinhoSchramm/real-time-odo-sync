# Real Time Odo Sync

This project was done in 3 days with the aim of solving a recurring problem of odometer accuracy due to the GV55 and GV50 equipment being part of the route without GSM and GPRS connection.

we used a Google form, where each driver would fill in their respective license plate, name and current vehicle odometer.

for full functionality of this project you need to have an active googlesheet api, and any sms sending api.
